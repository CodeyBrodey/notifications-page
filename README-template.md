- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lot about using React specifically how common hooks like usaState and useEffect are applied. As well as how to deploy using React.

### Continued development

I want to continue to get fmailiar with React and find differnet ways to create React projects besides using create-react-app which some say is outdated or unefficient.
